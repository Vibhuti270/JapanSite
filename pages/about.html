                <h2>Japanese Culture</h2>
                <p>Japan has a fascinating and multifaceted culture; on the one hand it is steeped in the deepest 
                    of traditions dating back thousands of years; on the other it is a society in a continual 
                    state of rapid flux, with continually shifting fads and fashions and technological development 
                    that constantly pushes back the boundaries of the possible. This is part of what makes it such a 
                    fascinating country to visit. If you are in search of the extraordinary, our Japan holidays promise to deliver just that.
